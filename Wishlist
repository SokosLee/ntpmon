Here's my current wishlist for those interested in the development side:

- Add GUI ASAP:
    - Status display
    - Controls: pause, cancel, change speed
    - First run assistant

- Remove dependency on hal-device command line utility.  I assume there is some
  Gnome2::VFS call that will allow this, but i can't find it in the
  documentation.

- Remove dependency on sqlite3 and use only DBD::SQLite functions.  This will
  require selecting the commands from the sqlite_master table, and selecting
  all data from the table in SQL insert format.

- Add support for gphoto2 so that PTP cameras and the like can be supported.
  The main blocker for this is that there are no libgphoto2 perl bindings, and
  the output that the gphoto2 command line tool produces is rather obtuse.

- Allow selected EXIF info to be used in the file path within the library, so
  that things like a separate folder for each camera can be implemented.

- Add features:
    - Rescan library: remove database entries for missing files, re-check
      md5sums.  This needs a warning that it could result in recopying of
      files.  Or perhaps the obsolete files could be moved to another table, or
      marked as deleted at a particular time.
    - Prune library: find and remove duplicate files in library based on
      md5sums.  Need to provide a tick list defaulting everything to off.  GUI
      should recommend a library rescan to be done before this.
    - Reorganise library: re-file images in appropriate directories based on
      the current settings file paths within the library.
    - Consolidate libraries: re-file images from one library to another - may
      be implemented as a media-to-library copy with a library location as the
      source and a delete time of zero.
    - Allow sharing of library data (to facilitate network use)?
	- store SQLite DB in library?
	- make path in library relative to library directory?

- If invoked with no parameters, offer a menu of choices, possibly including:
    - re-run startup assistant with existing values set as defaults
    - add/remove library locations (optionally including pruning or scanning
      the database)
    - all of the above library maintenance features
