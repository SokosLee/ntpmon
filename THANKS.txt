Special thanks to:

- Tobias Oetiker, for his great RRDtool <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>.

And as usual:

- Jesus the Messiah, for his amazing grace and love towards me.

- Neal Morse <http://www.nealmorse.com/>, for producing amazing progressive
  rock which inspires and soothes while i code!

- The Linux community for producing an operating system that works so well,
  especially the Debian <http://www.debian.org/> and Ubuntu
  <http://www.ubuntu.com/> teams.

And a special apology to:

- The next person who had to touch the NTP setup on the HP-UX systems at
  Queensland Police Service <http://www.police.qld.gov.au/> after i left,
  whoever that might be.  I knew basically nothing about NTP when i set it up
  (except that NTP is a good idea), so i'm sorry for the mess i left you. :-)
