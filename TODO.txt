Some tasks i've set myself or ideas for improvement (feedback requested):

- Performance seems a little sluggish in viewing the host summary pages.
  This may be fixed now due to the removal of the hourly, monthly, and
  3-monthly graphs.  If not, a workaround for this would be to create a
  separate entry point in the CGI script for the larger graphs and only
  generate them when they are required.

- Write the help file.

- Modularise some of the utility functions (e.g. logging).

- Write something to automatically detect the best settings for
  installation based on presence or absence of directories/files/users.

- Add some bling.  HTML & CSS is pretty bland nowadays.  Input gratefully
  accepted on this!  Rewriting the display stuff in terms of a more modern
  perl web library would be desirable.

- Perhaps a better long-term strategy which would take care of the point
  above (and possibly the one below) would be to port NTPmon to PHP and
  implement it as a module in Observium <http://www.observium.org/>.

- Make it easier to add/change/remove metrics.  Make it possible to do this
  without trashing old RRD files.
