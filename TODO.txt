Some tasks i've set myself or ideas for improvement (feedback requested):

- Possibly merge the synchronization status and peer count graphs.

- The hourly and monthly graphs are pretty useless due to the resolution of
  the data kept.  They probably should disappear, or at least be reduced to
  thumbnails.

- Add summary graphs/thumbnails for the 3 monthly and yearly graphs?

- Performance seems a little sluggish in viewing the host detail pages. This
  is probably due to generating all of the large graphs behind the scenes.  A
  workaround for this would be to create a separate entry point in the CGI
  script for the larger graphs and only generate them when they are required.
  However, if we thumbnail the quarterly & yearly graphs this may eliminate
  any performance gains made by separating them out, since the overhead may be
  in pulling the RRD data into memory.  (NTPmon's data files are fairly large
  by RRD's standards, due to their small interval.)

- Write the help file.

- Modularise some of the utility functions (e.g. logging).

- Write something to automatically detect the best settings for installation.
  Using facter if it is present would be a good start.  Import the info from
  http://libertysys.com.au/node/84

- Add some bling.  HTML & CSS is pretty bland nowadays.  Input gratefully
  accepted on this!  Rewriting the display stuff in terms of a more modern
  perl web library would be desirable.

- Perhaps a better long-term strategy which would take care of the point above
  (and possibly the one below) would be to port NTPmon to PHP and implement it
  as a module in Observium <http://www.observium.org/>.

- Make it easier to add/change/remove metrics.  Make it possible to do this
  without trashing old RRD files.
