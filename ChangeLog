Changes from previous version
-----------------------------

NTPmon has been rewritten from version 1.0.0 of check_ntpmon.  Changes from
check_ntpmon are:

- Now requires python 3.

- Removed dependency on GNU coreutils.

- Added support for detecting ntptrace loops.

- Added support for Nagios performance data:
  https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/3/en/perfdata.html

- Added collectd daemon.

- Added telegraf daemon.

- Removed support for changing thresholds; if the one person on the Internet
  who actually uses this really wants it, I might add it back. :-)
