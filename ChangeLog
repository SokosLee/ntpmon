	* Do not log data for stats which are not valid for the interval.  This
	  creates gaps in the graphs rather than ugly drops to zero and back.
	* Add min, avg, and max figures for the interval to the peer count and
	  time offset graphs.
	* Warn instead of die if a host RRD cannot be created or updated.  If
	  there is a problem with just one host's database, the collector
	  will now continue instead of failing on the first bad host.
	* Changed offset graph to milliseconds as it was pre-0.1.
