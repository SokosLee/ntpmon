	* A disconcerting number of NTP servers out in the world produce
	  absolute rubbish in the peer column of ntpq's output (which is still
	  better than what openntpd produces, which is nothing).  We now suppress
	  all warning messages and log the failures to syslog instead, reducing
	  email noise.

2010-08-23	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.5
	* Try to handle anomalous output from ntpq (especially refids) more sensibly.
	  Erroneous output from ntpq is saved to assist with diagnosis.

2010-03-05	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.4
	* Change cutoff for numpeers and numsurvivors to be slightly less than
	  3 so that rounding approximation doesn't cause hosts to show as marginal.
	* Redirect ntpq errors to /dev/null so we avoid errors showing up in
	  email.  The polling metrics (or absence thereof) will more than
	  adequately show any errors.

2010-03-01	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.3
	* Correct problem where some columns are skipped entirely if they
	  contain invalid data.

2010-02-28	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.2
	* SLES 10 requires ENV to be untainted as well as PATH.
	* Add some extra explanations to the README.
	* Skip peers which are in .INIT. state - these have never worked.  It
	  is common for a host's own IP to be included as a peer (for
	  consistency of configuration), and it will always appear in the
	  .INIT. state, so NTPmon counts this as a non-error.
	* When there is no data to be displayed (usually when a host has just
	  been added for collection), NTPmon now skips it, eliminating noise
	  error messages in the apache error log.
	* Minor fixes in graph display.
	* Improved installation process.
	* Ownership of the RRD databases & images now regularly (every 5
	  minutes by default) changed to the apache user.

2010-02-28	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.1
	* Do not log data for stats which are not valid for the interval.  This
	  creates gaps in the graphs rather than ugly drops to zero and back.
	* Add min, avg, and max figures for the interval to the peer count and
	  time offset graphs.
	* Warn instead of die if a host RRD cannot be created or updated.  If
	  there is a problem with just one host's database, the collector
	  will now continue instead of failing on the first bad host.
	* Changed offset graph to milliseconds as it was pre-0.1.

2010-02-27	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1
	* Initial release
